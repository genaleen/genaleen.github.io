              <p class="T-Text">Intramuros, Manila<br>With tropical islands, beautiful landscapes, and unending adventure, the Philippines is a great destination, and I am very grateful to live here. One of the best places I have visited is Intramuros and Fort Santiago, Manila. This place is excellent for Taking a journey down memory lane in Manila's walled Intramuros, one of the country's most famous sites. Miguel Lopez de Legazpi built this 64-hectare Spanish fortification, which was destroyed before the conclusion of World War II. </br></p>

              <p class="T-Text">Baclaran Church in Manila<br>Wednesdays are popularly called “Baclaran Day” due to congested roads brought on by pilgrims to the shrine. Thousands of devotees flood the National Shrine of Baclaran every Wednesday to attend Mass and pray the Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help. There are 5 Masses and 13 Novena Services every Wednesday.</br></p>

              <p class="T-Text">Orani, Bataan<br>Upon visiting the Municipality of Orani, I experienced raw and organic life that I had never seen or felt before. I could feel the unadulterated warmth and kindness the people in Orani were made up of. Material and tainted influences were absent. The simplest ways of life are lived here and the people were content with what they have. The Old Port area of Orani left such an immense feeling that I carry with me each day, waiting inside until I have a chance to revisit this wonderful place.</br></p>

              <p class="T-Text">Batanes<br>What makes Batanes unique is that being there is like getting lost in another world where time and technology do not matter. Internet connection is rare. It is a cash economy. Life is quiet, peaceful, and slow. The Ivatan tribe that lives there still preserves its culture. People are pure and honest. I forgot my wallet at a tourist attraction and got it back. The scenery is picturesque and breathtaking, whether it be hills or the ocean. Local food is heavenly delicious and cheap.</br></p>

              <p class="T-Text">Our Lady of Piat, Cagayan Valley<br>Whenever I am in Tuguegarao we never fail to go to Our Lady of Piat Shrine. Our travel here would never be complete without saying a prayer inside this old church. A lot of people are saying that the image of the Lady is Miraculous and I can sense that the miracle is throughout the vicinity of the church, The basilica grounds are spacious and well-kept. The traffic rerouting worked well. The Basilica's interior is elegant and radiates serenity. For mementos, don't forget to stop by the basilica gift store.</br></p>

              <p class="T-Text">Malate<br>Passing the Rajah Sulayman Park with the Malate Church, we went to the direction of the Manila Bay, where you can find the waterside promenade Manila Baywalk. With good weather, you can enjoy a nice and relaxed walk along the water. But I wouldn’t consider it as a must-see though.</br></p>

              <p class="T-Text">Rizal Park<br>The largest and probably most famous park of Manila has some highlights, e.g. the Rizal Monument, the Kilometre Zero or the giant Relief of the Philippines. Well, they didn’t knock my socks off however. Maybe it was because of the many clouds above the city and on a sunny day you can spend some nice hours here indeed. Many Filipinos like to come to the park and there’s always something going on or to see. As we were here during the time before Christmas, everything was nicely decorated, people were singing and the atmosphere was just beautiful.</br></p>

P. and dedicated to the patron Saint San Matias, 1707. Separated from Cabagan and became a regular parish in 1751.
