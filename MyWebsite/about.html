                One's personality is something that does not change, making us unique and special. I am Genaleen Anne A. Eusebio. We are 6 in our family: my grandparents, parents, and brother, and I am the eldest. My father is a janitor, while my mother is a housewife. I am very close with my grandparents, and I can tell my parents just about anything. I respect my parents and grandparents and help them to do house works, such as doing laundry, cleaning the house, gardening and washing the dishes. I also help out friends and classmates when they need help and whenever I can help them. I give out advice and suggestions to them when they need support and service as well. Generally, I can say that I am a responsible person who does my duties.

                I just turned 21 this July 06 and am currently a 2nd-year student majoring in Information Technology at Isabela State University. As for me, I am a reliable, sympathetic person, and I am also quite shy. Socializing and presenting lots of things with people is quite hard for me because of my condition that is with my throat causing me to somehow lose the ability to speak clearly and deliver items properly because I believe that our voice is one of the most important assets in our life to live, our voice is a way for us to make a deep connection with people, and to use this to express ourselves. Truly it is said, one cannot study from books alone. Instead, one has to learn from all extracurricular activities in which one participates. I am a sports enthusiast. I can play a lot of different kinds of sports, but my forte is badminton. I also love listening to music and playing other mobile or online games. It makes me feel content having the chance to meet many people through games while enjoying them. I also love to do arts in my past time and at home most of the time I cook our food which I want to do. My family, especially my grandmother, has been a source of encouragement and motivation for me. That is why I am a truly self-inspired, strengthened and dedicated fellow today to achieve my goals and dreams. I have learned much from my mistakes and failures and will still learn through time. I never regard my failure as a curse but rather as an opportunity to improve and improvise. One should strive hard to improve not only his lot but for his fellow beings. The best of all services is that which benefits humanity. I have learned from my experience and struggles that one should never stop working hard and be confident, positive, and adaptable to all conditions. The biggest achievement is when one becomes unbeatable. Only then can one approach life with all of their strength and confidence.

                Writing about myself allows me to explain that everything I experience, see, and plan for my life is a direct result of what I do right now. I make an effort to be modest, passionate, committed, diligent, and honest. My parents are by far my best mentors, in my opinion. My parents have taught me the true meaning and value of life. I live with a contented, committed, and diligent family. That is without a doubt the greatest gift from God to me. </p>
