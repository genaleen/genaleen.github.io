                              <p>Gena is one of my high school friends and she is not like other people who like to show off cause she's more of an introverted one, she only speaks to the people she's comfortable with and I am one of those people. She doesn't talk much but when she's around the people she likes she is very noisy and happy, she is also a sporty one and an artist too! but what she's good at is about techs and editing pictures.  Just by looking at her, you will never know how good a person she is and how talented she is, cause most of the time she doubts herself on the things she is capable of, but for us, that know her we know that she excels well and grow more. The hardest part of being an introvert is that the people you get used to being with will eventually leave and for us, we know that's her hardest days when we got separated we know among all of us she was the one who suffers but I am proud of her that she overcomes those hardest situation of hers we might not talk 24/7 like others do.  But we know her, we know her she is strong, talented, kind, loving, sporty and a good sibling to her brother, and with that we are so proud of her and with her maturity and achievements despite how hard life is. </p>

                              <img src="IMAGES/EUGENE.png" class="img-circle img-responsive" /><p>People say that high school life is the best part a student has experienced in life, and yes, I agree because this is where I found my best friend, her name's Genaleen Eusebio. She is the type of person who seems quiet but very observant of her surroundings. We both love playing badminton as a habit until we both made it our sport. Genaleen is a type of friend with whom you can share secrets, she is a very trustworthy friend. Every time I have a problem with my laptop, she was just one call away and ready to help me since in our group of friends she was our techy girl. We should also not forget about her appearance because, to be honest, she has the looks, she was beautiful, she was like a rose, a beautiful flower with thorns. Her personality seems mysterious too not unless she trusted you. And I also know she trusted me that's why we are close enough to call each other siblings. In our 9 years of friendship since high school, we fought countless battles in life, we shared our ups and downs in life. And we will continue what we started to fight for our dreams and ambition in life. In my conclusion, Genaleen is such a rare gem to find she is truly a great friend with which you could trust her very well. </p>

One of a friend that I trust the most. Despite her being the quiet one, you have something to say to everyone. Genaleen is the kind of friend you can confide in; she is a friend you can put your trust in. She was always available and willing to assist me whenever I had a laptop problem because she was the techie in our group of pals. We are aware that when we parted ways after high school, going to be a hard moment for her, and she suffered more than the rest of us. Although we may not always communicate the same way as other people, we both recognize that she is a strong, talented, kind, loving, athletic, and nice sister to her brother. As a result, I am proud of her for conquering those particularly challenging conditions, you always try tasks that you formerly doubted your ability to complete, but because you are a strong and independent woman, you always manage to succeed, we experienced our ups and downs in life and battled innumerable fights together. And we'll keep up the fight for our aspirations and dreams in life. Genaleen is, in my opinion, a jewel that is hard to come by and a true friend you can trust completely. </p>

She behaves toward me well and helps always. I met her in class in grade 8 and became best friends. She is my true friend because she understands me very well and cares for my every need. I like her very much. I never had any friend like her ever before. My and other friends always go to her home to talk and have fun, and the bond she always takes care of us. She is an open-minded girl and never feels bad for my misbehavior. She is very entertaining and makes me laugh through her interesting jokes out of the blue sometimes. She is shy and very cute and attractive; good at sports and academic activities. She takes my opinions in her every tough work to do in the right way. We manage to share things in our difficult times and I can say that she is a good friend. </p>

                              <img src="IMAGES/GLYSSA.png" class="img-circle img-responsive" /><p>Genaleen is different, a person who has been such a good friend to me, silent, can be trusted, silly sometimes, and shy. She can develop her talents in the area she's interested in when she puts effort into it. She is one of the genuine and kindest people to me and I can say that she is someone that I can call away when I need someone to talk to, she doesnâ€™t judge people and tries to know them first, I can say that she is also someone I'm very comfortable and can talk a lot of things with and I think everyone should have a friend like you. She greets everyone with warmth and is quite amiable. She inspires us all, speaks in a very courteous manner, and never gets into a fight with me or anybody else. Instead, she chooses to remain silent. She is a kind friend who never forgets to think of me. </p>

A best friend is someone with whom we share all of the most crucial things in our life and Genaleen is one of them. I can say that Genaleen is very supportive. I canâ€™t even remember when we became friends which shows how long we have been friends. We understand each other so well and she is always there to listen to me and comfort me when I am sad and not feeling too good. My best friend is a unique companion, the one among my friends who does the best things for me, for me, and with me. She is simply indispensable and indescribable, quite shy but she can still manage to make good friends and she is a strong individual that I know can achieve a lot in the future. </p>

She is quite shy but is a nice girl and helps in nature. True friendship is very necessary for all of us to go ahead and get right track in life. Getting the best and true friends in life is a very tough task however some luckiest one gets it. She is the first person among my all friends with whom I can share my all feeling. She is very good and helps everyone. She performs well in sports. She has a good personality and loves to help needy people. She is very friendly to everyone and meets warmly. She motivates us all; she also talks very politely and never quarrels with me and others she just stays quiet. She is a compassionate friend and always cares for me. </p>

All I can say is that she is a ball of endless possibilities and an individual full of potential. She is a living testimonial that self-teaching is possible. When she puts her mind to it, she can develop her skills in the field she's interested in. Gena would often tell me that there is a huge gap between her and words, although I don't agree with this because I have seen her speaking her mind out and taking space when confronted with a difficult situation, and I can say that she knows how to analyze the environment and formulate the right words to pacify the tension, I can also say that she has the gift of giving comfort just by listening. She is a true empath and comfort in human form. </p>

                              <p>  I am lucky enough to have a best friend in life. Genaleen is my best friend of mine. I call her Gena. She truly loves me and understands me fully. She is my class fellow, she has always had a genuine heart.  I am very much happy and thankful to God for blessing me with a true and sincere friend like Gena. I always pray for stability and the long long life of our friendship. She is quiet, adorable, and talented in both athletics and other academic pursuits. She considers my opinions while deciding how to tackle difficult tasks. Life continues its incredible journey, so many intimate friends moved in and out of my life, but none replaced the sole position reserved for my best friends and Genaleen is one of those people, now a strong woman, who stood by my side. </p>
